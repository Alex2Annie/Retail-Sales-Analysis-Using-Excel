Retail Sales Dataset Analysis üìä

In this project, I analyzed a **Retail Sales** dataset using Excel to gain insights and optimize decision-making. The analysis involved various Excel functions and tools to summarize, calculate, and visualize sales data.

## Key Excel Functions Used üîß
- **SUM()**: Calculated total sales for each item and category.
- **AVERAGE()**: Determined average sales across various periods.
- **UNIQUE()**: Identified unique product IDs, regions, and sales representatives.
- **VLOOKUP()**: Merged additional data by matching product IDs and sales reps.
- **SUMIF() & SUMIFS()**: Filtered data based on specific conditions to calculate total sales.
- **Cell Referencing**: Used absolute and relative references to ensure accurate formulas.
  
## Excel Tools Utilized üõ†Ô∏è
- **Pivot Table**: Summarized and analyzed data for quick insights.
- **Pivot Chart**: Created visual charts (bar, line, pie) to highlight trends and sales patterns.
- **Slicers**: Added slicers to the pivot table for easy data filtering by regions, sales reps, etc.

## Key Metrics Calculated üí°
- **Commission**: Calculated commission for sales representatives based on sales and commission rate.
  - Formula: `Commission = Sales * Commission Rate`

- **Total Sales**: Summed the total sales across different regions and categories.
  - Formula: `Total Sales = SUM(Sales)`
