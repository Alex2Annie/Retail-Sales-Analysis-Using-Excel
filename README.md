# Retail Sales Data Analysis üìä

Welcome to the **Retail Sales Data Analysis** project! In this project, I analyzed a **retail sales dataset** using **Excel**. The dataset covers sales data segmented by **product categories** and **customer segments** (such as **Adult**, **Senior**, **Young Adult**). I utilized various Excel functions and features to derive key insights, such as total sales and commission calculations.

## Project Overview üîç

The goal of this project was to analyze sales performance and provide key metrics such as **commission** and **total sales**. Using Excel's advanced functions and tools, I was able to clean and summarize the data, calculate sales and commissions, and visualize the results with **pivot tables**, **pivot charts**, and **slicers**.

### Key Excel Functions and Tools Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **SUM()**: To calculate the total sales for each product category and customer type.
- **AVERAGE()**: To compute average sales for each segment.
- **UNIQUE()**: To identify unique values in the dataset (e.g., unique product categories).
- **VLOOKUP()**: Used to merge data from different tables based on matching values.
- **SUMIF() & SUMIFS()**: For calculating totals based on specific conditions.
- **Cell Referencing**: Both absolute and relative references for dynamic formulas.
- **Pivot Tables**: To summarize the data in a more organized way, making it easier to analyze.
- **Pivot Charts**: For visualizing the sales data and identifying trends.
- **Slicers**: To allow users to filter data dynamically based on specific parameters.

## Key Metrics and Calculations üìà

### 1. **Commission Calculation** üí∏
I created a **Commission** column based on total sales and predefined commission rates for each sales representative. 

- Formula: `Commission = Total Sales * Commission Rate`

### 2. **Total Sales Calculation** üí∞
The **Total Sales** column aggregates the total sales across various categories and customer types using the **SUMIFS()** function.

- Formula: `Total Sales = SUM(Sales)`

### 3. **Sales Breakdown by Product Category** üì¶

Here‚Äôs the sales breakdown across different customer types and product categories:

| Product Category | Adult  | Senior | Young Adult | **Grand Total** |
|------------------|--------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Beauty           | 63,720 | 34,085 | 45,710      | 143,515         |
| Clothing         | 59,840 | 47,070 | 48,670      | 155,580         |
| Electronics      | 56,340 | 62,000 | 38,565      | 156,905         |
| **Grand Total**  | 179,900| 143,155| 132,945     | **456,000**     |

### 4. **Pivot Table & Pivot Chart** üìëüìä
- **Pivot Tables** were created to group and summarize sales data by product category and customer type.
- **Pivot Charts** were generated to visualize the sales performance and trends across different categories and customer segments.

### 5. **Interactive Dashboard with Slicers** üîß
Slicers were added to the Pivot Table to allow users to filter the data dynamically based on product type, region, or customer type, making it easier to explore the data.
